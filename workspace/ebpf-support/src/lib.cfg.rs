/*

 * void *bpf_map_lookup_elem(struct bpf_map *map, const void *key)
 * 	Description
 * 		Perform a lookup in *map* for an entry associated to *key*.
 * 	Return
 * 		Map value associated to *key*, or **NULL** if no entry was
 * 		found.
 *
 
 
 * int bpf_map_update_elem(struct bpf_map *map, const void *key, const void *value, u64 flags)
 * 	Description
 * 		Add or update the value of the entry associated to *key* in
 * 		*map* with *value*. *flags* is one of:
 *
 * 		**BPF_NOEXIST**
 * 			The entry for *key* must not exist in the map.
 * 		**BPF_EXIST**
 * 			The entry for *key* must already exist in the map.
 * 		**BPF_ANY**
 * 			No condition on the existence of the entry for *key*.
 *
 * 		Flag value **BPF_NOEXIST** cannot be used for maps of types
 * 		**BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY** or **BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY**  (all
 * 		elements always exist), the helper would return an error.
 * 	Return
 * 		0 on success, or a negative error in case of failure.
 *
 
 
 * int bpf_map_delete_elem(struct bpf_map *map, const void *key)
 * 	Description
 * 		Delete entry with *key* from *map*.
 * 	Return
 * 		0 on success, or a negative error in case of failure.
